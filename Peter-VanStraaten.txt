Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

        An inline element displays as the width of the element, while a block element starts on a new line
        and takes up the full width.


    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?

        An element that is positioned absolutely is removed from the normal flow of the document. The other elements
        of the page will act as if the element that is position absolutely is not there and the element that is positioned
        absolutely will now reference its position from the document instead of the parent.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

        display: inline-block will display inline but will also give a width, height to the element.

        h2 {
            border: 1px dotted black;
            padding: 10px;
            display: inline-block;
            width: 100px;
        }

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
   
        Block by default:
            - <p>
            - <h1>
            - <div>

        Inline by default:
        
            - <img>
            - <a>
   
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

        Box model can be thought of as a way to think about laying out html elements with css.
        Think of each html wrapped in a box. There is a border that goes around the outside of the box 
        and the content goes inside the box. The space between the border and the content is referred to as the padding.
        The space betweent the border and the next html element is referred to as the margin. Using css
        we can control the layout, spacing and styling of html by using these changing the values.

        The issue with box model is that by default CSS applies padding and borders on top of elements.
        Therefore, if you want to set a width and height for the box you need to do math to factor in padding and border.

        The fix is using box-sizing: border-box. This factors in the padding and border into the width of the box so we
        don't need to do the math.

       We can do this by add the following to our css:

            *, *:before, *:after {
                box-sizing: border-box;
                -webkit-box-sizing; border-box;
                -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
            }
